    description:`Enter now, fair maidens and valiant squires,
    To witness the first act of this culinary tale..
    Behold, the cauldron of milk, as pure as snow,
    Set upon the hearth, its contents to bestow.

    With gentle flame, the milk doth stir and sway,
    Its surface kissed by the fire's tender ray.
    As bubbles rise, a symphony of sound,
    In this humble pot, a transformation profound.

    Oh, how the milk doth dance, in swirling delight,
    As if the very stars had descended this night.
    A potion of richness, to nourish and bless,
    In this alchemy of cookery, we find our success.

  So let us watch, with keen eyes aglow,
    As the milk boils and froths, in ebb and in flow.
    For in this simple act, we lay the foundation,
    Of a Maggie divine, fit for any occasion.`}
